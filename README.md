<h1>Google Books with React</h1>

<h2>Project Details</h2>
<p>This dynamically updating react application allows a user to search for books from the Google Book API, save any book to a separate page, and delete that book from their saved list. This application's UI is broken up into different components that are managed by state and respond to user events. <br><br> Data is fetched from the "https://www.googleapis.com/books/v1/volumes?q=search+terms" API, where the top 40 results are generated on the home screen based on the users Google Book Search input.<br><br> If the user clicks the save button on any specific book, an API request sends information to the backend to save book data to the MongoDB database. The same occurs when the delete button is clicked, however a delete request is send to eliminate that books data from the MongoDB database.</p>

<p>To start the server, clone the repository to your local desktop, run: "npm install" to download project dependencies, followed by "npm run dev" to launch the application in the local browser. Deployed link posted below.</p>
